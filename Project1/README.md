- Question1  
Build the the frog using Logisim.  
Attach 4 7-segment displays to the output of Register 0. 
Write a program that will calculate the expression given below and put the result into register 0.

[(((117|64)++)-(47&15))--]^!(12-95)  


-Question2  
Construct a Verilog code which will display the student numbers of both members of the group in a concatenated way. i.e. if the numbers 123456789 and 444444444, you will display 123456789444444444. This number will be displayed in 4-digit 7-Segment display in a sliding manner. The manner of the slide will be determined by the switches of the dip-switch.

* Switch 1 controls whether the speed is normal or double.

* Switch 2 controls whether we are operating on a rotate or swing mode.

* Switch 3 controls the direction of the rotation, i.e., whether it is from left to right or right to left. Switch 3 is not functional if we are on swing mode.

* Switch 4 controls whether the output blinks for a period of ¼ seconds (approximately) or not.
