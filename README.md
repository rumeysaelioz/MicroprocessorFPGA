# MicroprocessorFPGA
Take input from a 16-bit DIP-switch via polling and output to a four-digit 7-segment display. 
The output is unsynchronized. 
The program running on this system will read two 16 bits numbers as input from the switchboard and call a subroutine, passing these two numbers as arguments. 
The subroutine is add two numbers and display the result on 7-segment display.
